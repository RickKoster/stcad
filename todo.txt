Notes on gdsCAD files
- DONE #### How do I adjust the size of alignment marks? The default ones are way too big, alignment on the order of 2um
- DONE #### Hall bars
- DONE #### Reduce number of layouts, and create basechip in such a way that it is the final chip layout
- DONE #### on each chip two bondpads for testing
- DONE #### write classes and functions
- CURRENTLY: Move save_to_gds to parent class basechip. Here, I routinely get the following message: "TypeError: unhashable type: 'Layout'". Seems to be connected to inputting global variables???
- self.??? or global ???
- class squid
- class hallbar
- proper 3x3 grid on 25mm x 25mm chip
- jjmin to jjmax
- RF hangers
- RF hangers with junctions
- RF with DC bias
